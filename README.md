and to use media queries to alter certain properties such as image resizing on smaller screens

```html
<li>
    <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong>
    In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
</li>
```
